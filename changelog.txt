 - changelog created! \o/
 - "const" added to all PROGMEM variables for compatibity with the last avrgcc update
	It will require you to add "const" before the variables which use PROGMEM or you'll get compilation errors
 - gb.startMenu() function added. It's used to display the main menu instead of gb.begin()
	It should be called just after gb.begin() with the arguments you were used to put in the gb.begin() function.
	It allows you to display the main menu again whenever you want.
